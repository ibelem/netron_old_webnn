# Model Required Ops and WebNN API Support Status

This tool is based on [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron). [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) is a viewer for neural network, deep learning and machine learning models developed by [Lutz Roeder](https://github.com/lutzroeder).

The revised version could show WebNN API support status for loaded models.
